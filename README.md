# Assigment 43

Complete the following tasks by only using the command line. If you're on Replit, create a new project and execute commands in the "Shell" tab. Before starting, make sure you have two files: `Main.java`, which will have your `main()` method that creates a `Student` object and prints the object info to the console, and `Student.java` which will be a record class with `name`, `grade`, and `gpa` instance variables.

1. Check what directory you're in. It should be `/home/runner/<name of project>`.
1. List the files. You should see your two Java files listed (and maybe a few others as well).
1. Create a new directory called `Subfolder`.
1. Copy `Main.java` into `Subfolder`.
1. Move `Student.java` into `Subfolder`.
1. Change your directory to `Subfolder`.
1. Compile the two java files.
1. List the files. There should be four files.
